### **Microservices Architecture**

Our platform consists of 6 specialized microservices:

| Service | Purpose | Database | Port |
|---------|---------|----------|------|
| **User Service** | Authentication & User Management | PostgreSQL | 3001 |
| **Product Service** | Product Catalog & Search | MongoDB | 3002 |
| **Order Service** | Order Processing & Fulfillment | PostgreSQL | 3003 |
| **Payment Service** | Payment Processing & Billing | PostgreSQL | 3004 |
| **Inventory Service** | Stock Management & Reservations | PostgreSQL + Redis | 3005 |
| **Notification Service** | Email, SMS & Push Notifications | MongoDB | 3006 |

### **Infrastructure Components**

- **API Gateway** (Port 8080) - Request routing and authentication
- **Frontend** (Port 3000) - React.js user interface
- **Databases** - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Monitoring** - Integrated metrics and logging
- **Container Orchestration** - Docker & Kubernetes support
